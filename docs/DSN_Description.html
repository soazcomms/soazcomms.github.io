    <h1>Understanding the Southern Arizona Dark Sky Network</h1>

    <div class="emphasis" style="margin-top: 24pt;">
        <h2 style="margin-top: 0; color: #1a1a1a;">Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The Southern Arizona Dark Sky Network (DSN) is an environmental monitoring system that addresses one of the most overlooked yet pervasive threats to our ecosystem: light pollution. Comprising 35 advanced sensors deployed across Southern Arizona, the DSN continuously measures the night sky brightness to protect a $550 million astronomical economy, safeguard critical wildlife habitats in the biodiverse Sonoran Desert, and address significant human health impacts from artificial light at night.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Light pollution disrupts nocturnal pollinators essential to desert ecosystems, disorients migrating birds, suppresses human melatonin production leading to sleep disorders and increased disease risk, and threatens the "world capital of astronomy's" pristine observing conditions. Unlike other forms of pollution requiring decades of remediation, light pollution is uniquely reversible—turn off a light, and the pollution disappears instantly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What We're Doing:</strong> Using proven SQM (Sky Quality Meter) and TESS sensor technologies, the DSN serves as an early warning system, detecting light pollution increases before they become critical, guiding evidence-based lighting policy decisions, and documenting the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Data from the network is publicly accessible at darkskysoaz.org, empowering communities to see real-time changes in their night skies and understand the direct connection between lighting choices and environmental health.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Current Status:</strong> Sensor deployment began in spring 2025, with full network operation expected by mid-2026. Early results are already available for visualization and analysis, establishing crucial baseline measurements that will guide future conservation decisions and demonstrate that protecting darkness protects life itself.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>The Southern Arizona Dark Sky Network (DSN) is a system of 35 sensors spread across Southern Arizona that measure the brightness of the night sky. Think of them as "weather stations" for the night sky – they continuously track its brightness and how it changes over time.</p>

    <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
    <p>Southern Arizona is home to world-famous astronomical observatories and has been called the "world capital of astronomy." The region's dark skies are worth over $550 million annually to the local economy and support thousands of jobs. But light pollution from cities can travel hundreds of miles, threatening these precious dark skies.</p>

    <h2>The hidden environmental crisis</h2>
    <p>Unlike other forms of pollution, light pollution affects virtually every aspect of our ecosystem – yet it remains one of the least understood environmental threats:</p>

    <p><strong>Effects on Wildlife and Ecosystems:</strong></p>
    <p>The Sonoran Desert, one of the world's most biodiverse deserts, hosts numerous species whose survival depends on natural darkness:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nocturnal pollinators</strong> like moths and bats become disoriented by artificial light, disrupting pollination of desert plants including iconic saguaro cacti</li>
        <li><strong>Migrating birds</strong> are drawn off course by bright lights, leading to fatal collisions with buildings and exhaustion</li>
        <li><strong>Desert predators and prey</strong> have their hunting and foraging patterns disrupted, breaking food chains</li>
        <li><strong>Insects</strong> are fatally attracted to lights, devastating populations that form the foundation of desert food webs</li>
        <li><strong>Sea turtles</strong> and other species that navigate by natural light become confused, threatening entire generations</li>
        <li><strong>Plant flowering and seasonal cycles</strong> are thrown off by constant artificial twilight</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Human Health Impacts:</strong></p>
    <p>Artificial light at night doesn't just harm wildlife – it directly affects human health:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sleep disruption:</strong> Exposure to light at night suppresses melatonin production, leading to insomnia and poor sleep quality</li>
        <li><strong>Increased disease risk:</strong> Studies link nighttime light exposure to higher rates of obesity, diabetes, depression, and certain cancers</li>
        <li><strong>Circadian rhythm disruption:</strong> Our bodies evolved with natural day-night cycles; constant light exposure confuses our internal clocks, affecting everything from hormone production to immune function</li>
        <li><strong>Mental health:</strong> Loss of connection to natural night skies contributes to anxiety and disconnection from nature</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="emphasis">
        <p><strong>The good news: Light pollution is uniquely reversible</strong></p>
        <p>Here's what makes light pollution different from other environmental challenges: <strong>it's the most straightforward form of pollution to control.</strong> Unlike air or water pollution, which can take decades to clean up and require complex chemical processes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn off a light, and the pollution disappears instantly</li>
            <li>No expensive cleanup or remediation required</li>
            <li>Benefits appear immediately, not after years of effort</li>
            <li>Simple, cost-effective solutions like shielding, dimming, and better timing</li>
            <li>Often saves money through reduced energy costs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This makes light pollution one of the most solvable environmental problems we face. Every properly shielded light fixture, every unnecessary light turned off, and every community that adopts smart lighting policies creates immediate benefits for wildlife, human health, and energy conservation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Our monitoring technology</h2>
    <p>The Dark Sky Network uses two types of widely used sensors to measure night sky brightness:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SQM (Sky Quality Meter)</strong> – Manufactured by <a href="https://unihedron.com/projects/darksky/" target="_blank" style="color: #2e5090; text-decoration: underline;">Unihedron</a>, these robust devices have been the gold standard for sky brightness measurement since 2005. They provide accurate, calibrated measurements in magnitudes per square arcsecond.</li>
        <li><strong>TESS (Telescope Encoder and Sky Sensor)</strong> – Developed by the <a href="https://tess.stars4all.eu/" target="_blank" style="color: #2e5090; text-decoration: underline;">Stars4All</a> project in Europe, these networked sensors provide continuous automated monitoring and are part of a global citizen science network measuring light pollution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both sensor types provide complementary data, giving us a comprehensive picture of sky brightness across Southern Arizona. The combination of these technologies allows us to validate measurements and ensure the highest quality data for research and advocacy.</p>

    <h2>What does the DSN do?</h2>
    <p>The network acts as an early warning system for light pollution. By continuously monitoring sky brightness across the region, it can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detect increases in light pollution before they become serious problems</li>
        <li>Help direct conservation efforts where they're most needed</li>
        <li>Support evidence-based decisions about outdoor lighting policies that protect both human and ecosystem health</li>
        <li>Complement satellite observations with ground-level data</li>
        <li>Document the effectiveness of lighting improvements, showing communities that their efforts make a real difference</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The bigger picture</h2>
    <p>This project helps Southern Arizona protect one of its most valuable natural resources – its dark night skies – while supporting astronomical research, human health, desert wildlife survival, and energy conservation. The data will be publicly available at darkskysoaz.org, allowing everyone to see how their local night sky is changing over time and understand the connection between outdoor lighting choices and environmental health.</p>

    <h2>When?</h2>
    <p>We began deploying sensors in spring 2025, with full operation expected by mid-2026. This represents a critical moment: by establishing baseline measurements now, we can track changes, guide policy decisions, and demonstrate that protecting darkness protects life itself.</p>

    <h2>See the data yourself</h2>
    <p>Early results from the Dark Sky Network are already available and can be visualized at: <a href="https://soazcomms.github.io/DSNweb.v04.html" target="_blank" style="color: #2e5090; text-decoration: underline;">https://soazcomms.github.io/DSNweb.v04.html</a></p>
    
    <p>The data are freely available for download to all users. For instructions on how to access and use the data, please see: <br><a href="https://soazcomms.github.io/docs/Usage.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #2e5090; text-decoration: underline;">Data Usage Instructions</a></p>
    
    <p><strong>Here is an example visualization:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin: 24pt 0;">
        <img src="https://soazcomms.github.io/docs/DSN_example.png" alt="Dark Sky Network visualization example" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Understanding the visualization:</strong></p>
    <p>This dashboard shows data from a single monitoring station (DSN003-S_Sugarloaf) over approximately two weeks in late May to early June 2025. The visualization displays four key metrics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SQM readings (top panel):</strong> Shows SQM data, the sky brightness in magnitudes per square arcsecond. The light blue line represents the measurements. No values are plotted when the sun is up.</li>
      <li><strong>Radiance (second panel):</strong> Shows SQM data converted to physical units of brightness, nW/cm²/sr, or nano (one billionth) Watt per square centimeter (the surface area of the detector) per steradian (see this <a href="https://soazcomms.github.io/docs/DSN_solid_angle.png" target="_blank" style="color: #2e5090; text-decoration: underline;">illustration</a>). In these units, higher values mean brighter skies.</li>
      <li><strong>Chi-squared cloudiness (third panel):</strong> An estimation of the presence of clouds. Spikes above 0.009 indicate cloudy periods.</li>
        <li><strong>Moon altitude (bottom panel):</strong> Shows the moon's position relative to the horizon. The corresponding natural variation in sky brightness is apparent in the SQM readings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Together, these panels tell a complete story about sky conditions: You can see the day-night cycle, identify when clouds passed through, understand the moon's influence, and detect any unusual brightness that might indicate light pollution. The consistent baseline sky brightness during moonless nights shows this location maintains excellent dark sky quality.</p>
    
    <h2>Understanding the measurements</h2>
    <p>When we measure how bright (or dark) the night sky is, we use two different units. Think of them as two different ways to measure the same thing – like measuring distance in miles versus kilometers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Here is an example of the difference in night sky brightness for a site with significant light pollution in Tucson and a dark sky in the Chiricahuas:</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin: 24pt 0;">
        <img src="https://soazcomms.github.io/docs/DSN_Chi_Tuc.png" alt="Comparison of sky radiance between Chiricahua and Tucson sites" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    </p>
    <p>As Tucson lights are turned off through the evening, the radiance decreases and then plateaus after midnight, when the Tucson/Chiricahua ratio of radiances settles at about 8. This demonstrates how even after most lights are turned off, urban light pollution maintains a significantly brighter sky throughout the night compared to pristine dark sky locations.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Magnitudes per square arcsecond (mag/arcsec²)</strong></p>
    <p>This is the astronomer's way of measuring brightness. It's a bit backwards from what you might expect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher numbers = darker sky</strong> (better for seeing stars!)</li>
        <li><strong>Lower numbers = brighter sky</strong> (more light pollution)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>22 mag/arcsec²</strong> = pristine dark sky (like a remote desert)</li>
        <li><strong>21 mag/arcsec²</strong> = excellent dark sky</li>
        <li><strong>19 mag/arcsec²</strong> = city outskirts with noticeable light pollution</li>
        <li><strong>17 mag/arcsec²</strong> = bright city sky where only the brightest stars are visible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The scale is logarithmic, meaning each whole number represents about 2.5 times more or less light. So a sky at 19 is about 2.5 times brighter than a sky at 20.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Nanowatts per square centimeter per steradian (nW/cm²/sr)</strong></p>
    <p>This measures the actual physical brightness – the amount of light energy hitting your eye from a patch of sky. Unlike magnitudes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Higher numbers = brighter sky</strong> (more light pollution)</li>
        <li><strong>Lower numbers = darker sky</strong> (less light pollution)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This works the way you'd naturally expect: more light = bigger number.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why two measurements?</strong></p>
    <p>Astronomers traditionally use magnitudes because that's how we've measured star brightness for centuries. But scientists and engineers often prefer the physical units (nW/cm²/sr) because they're easier to use in calculations and relate directly to the actual light levels.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Both measurements tell the same story – whether your night sky is dark enough to see the Milky Way or if light pollution is washing it out. We provide both so astronomers and scientists can each use what works best for them!</p>
