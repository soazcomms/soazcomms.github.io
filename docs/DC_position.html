    <h1>Data Centers and Outdoor Lighting</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
        <strong>Southern Arizona Chapter, DarkSky International</strong><br>
        December 2025
    </div>
    <hr>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Construction and operation of data centers is becoming increasingly common in the United States, driven by growing demand for cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital services. Interest in building and operating data centers in southern Arizona is also increasing, with recent proposals including the Beale Infrastructure project in Marana (public hearing scheduled December 10, 2025) and Project Blue near the Pima County Fairgrounds.</p>

    <h2>Chapter Position</h2>
    <p>The Southern Arizona Chapter of DarkSky International takes no position on whether data centers should or should not be built in our region. Questions of economic development, water use, energy consumption, and land use are beyond the scope of our mission. <strong>Our concern is focused solely on outdoor lighting.</strong></p>
    <p>As with any large industrial or commercial facility, we have concerns about the way outdoor lighting is used on data center grounds. Data centers typically operate 24/7, feature large parking areas, and include extensive perimeter security lighting—all factors that can contribute significantly to light pollution if not properly designed and controlled.</p>

    <h2>The Case for Concern: Evidence from Mesa, Arizona</h2>
    <p>Satellite observations provide compelling evidence that data centers can dramatically increase local light pollution when outdoor lighting is not adequately controlled.</p>
    <p>The figure below shows VIIRS Day-Night Band (DNB) satellite measurements of upward radiance from the location of Apple's Mesa data center (coordinates 111.6038°W, 33.3474°N) from 2012 to 2025:</p>
    <a href="https://soazcomms.github.io/docs/AppleMesaDC.png" target="_blank" style="color: #2e5090; text-decoration: underline;">example</a>
    <p>Key observations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Baseline (2012–2023):</strong> Radiance fluctuated between approximately 20–40 nW/cm²/sr, with a gradual upward trend</li>
        <li><strong>2024–2025:</strong> Radiance spiked dramatically, with multiple readings between 60–80 nW/cm²/sr—roughly <strong>double to triple</strong> the historical baseline</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> The sharp increase coincides with recent facility expansions and suggests inadequate control of outdoor lighting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This single facility now produces light emissions visible from space that rival or exceed those of small towns. The Mesa example demonstrates that without strong lighting standards and consistent enforcement, data centers can become significant point sources of light pollution.</p>

    <h2>Our Expectations</h2>
    <p>The Southern Arizona Chapter of DarkSky International expects that:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data centers should adhere to local outdoor lighting regulations</strong>, as we would expect of any property owner in our region.</li>
        <li><strong>Local authorities should correctly and consistently enforce existing lighting ordinances</strong> and not grant variances that weaken dark-sky protections for these projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting plans should be subject to public review</strong> before project approval, with opportunity for community input.</li>
        <li><strong>Dark-sky-friendly lighting is technically feasible</strong> for data center operations. We are not aware of any particular technical issue that prevents the installation and operation of fully shielded, warm-color-temperature, appropriately bright outdoor lighting on data center premises. Security and safety requirements can be met while minimizing light pollution.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <p>We will reserve judgment about any particular data center proposal until we are able to review their lighting plans. We stand ready to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide technical guidance on dark-sky-friendly lighting design</li>
        <li>Review and comment on proposed lighting plans</li>
        <li>Support local jurisdictions in strengthening and enforcing outdoor lighting codes</li>
        <li>Monitor night sky brightness through the Southern Arizona Dark Sky Network</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Southern Arizona's dark skies are a natural, economic, and scientific resource worth protecting. Our region hosts world-class astronomical observatories, supports a tourism economy built partly on access to starry skies, and provides critical dark habitat for nocturnal wildlife in the Sonoran Desert. Light pollution from poorly designed industrial facilities threatens all of these values.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>The good news:</strong> Light pollution is the most reversible form of pollution. Proper lighting design costs little more than conventional approaches, saves energy, and demonstrates corporate responsibility. We encourage data center developers to view dark-sky compliance not as a burden but as an opportunity to be good neighbors in a region that values its night skies.</p>
